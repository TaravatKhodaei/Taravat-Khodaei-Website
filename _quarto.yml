  description: "I am a PhD student in Biomedical Engineering at Case Western Reserve University, with five years of experience in biomaterials research specializing in immunometabolism engineering and immunotherapy for cancer and autoimmune diseases.
  I was able to contribute to the acedemic society through 11 published papers in this cutting-edge field. Currently, my laboratory work focuses on developing organoid models to mimic breast cancer biorespiration, providing valuable insights into cancer metabolism and potential therapeutic interventions.
