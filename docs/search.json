    "text": "This report consists of the selection of variables, data cleaning, imputation, exploratory data analysis, data partitioning, modeling, and assessment steps. Please refer to the main qmd file for acess to the full analysis. You can see selected results in the dashbord section. The ultimate goal is to investigate how key predictors, including severe housing problems, relate to life expectancy.\n\n1 Variable Selection\nOutcome Variable Life Expectancy (quantitative) Life expectancy is chosen as the outcome variable because it is a central measure of overall population health. It contains more than 15 unique values, meeting the required criteria.\nKey Predictor\nSevere Housing Problems (categorical)\nSevere Housing Problems will be categorized into 3-6 groups using quantiles, ensuring at least 30 observations in each category.\nOther Predictors (3-8 Variables)\n\nPhysical Inactivity (quantitative): Percentage of adults reporting no physical activity.\nIncome Inequality (quantitative): A measure of socioeconomic disparity.\nAir Pollution (quantitative): Level of fine particulate matter (PM2.5).\nSocial Associations (quantitative): Number of membership associations per 10,000 population.\nPreventable Hospital Stays (quantitative): Rate of hospital stays preventable with effective outpatient care.\n\nThese predictors offer a diverse perspective on the factors potentially affecting life expectancy.\n\n\n2 Explanatory Data Analysis (EDA)\nDuring the exploratory data analysis (EDA), I examined the distributions of both the outcome (life expectancy) and the selected predictors, using summary statistics, histograms, and Q-Q plots to assess their shapes and identify any potential outliers (not shown in the dashboard). I calculated correlation coefficients to explore relationships among variables, noting in particular that physical inactivity exhibited a strong negative association with life expectancy (refer to relationship). Boxplots and scatterplots further helped us visualize variability and patterns in the data, including the influence of categorical categories for severe housing problems.\nI did further heat map analysis for the relationship and correlation study, the strongest relationship is the relationship between life expectancy and physical inactivity (-0.731) is the most notable, suggesting that physical inactivity is highly detrimental to life expectancy. Thr moderate relationships is the relationship between income inequality (-0.423) and preventable hospital stays (-0.449) have moderate negative correlations with life expectancy, suggesting that these factors are somewhat associated with lower life expectancy. In the end our weak relationships are variables like severe housing problems, air pollution, and social associations show weak correlations with life expectancy, meaning their impact is less pronounced but still worth investigating. These correlations provide useful insights into the factors that may influence life expectancy in your data. next, we used a box plot to identify outliers (not shown).\n\n\n3 Partitioning the Data\nI then created a training sample (75% of the data) and a test sample (25%) for model development and validation. We know that partitioning the data into a training set and a test set is a critical step in building reliable predictive models. The training set is used to develop the model by estimating parameters, such as regression coefficients, while the test set is used to evaluate the model’s performance on unseen data. This separation helps prevent overfitting, where a model memorizes the training data instead of learning generalizable patterns. By testing the model on a separate dataset, we can assess its predictive power through metrics like RMSE, MAE, and R^2. This helps ensuring that the model performs well on new data. Partitioning also balances the bias-variance tradeoff, helping the model capture meaningful relationships without becoming overly complex.\n\n\n4 Model Develoments\nIn the dashboard you can see the final results of our model development in the model results section. In the model development phase, we aimed to produce two complementary regression models to address our central research question: how effectively do our chosen predictors explain variability in life expectancy?\nThe Full Model incorporated all selected predictors including severe housing problems, physical inactivity, income inequality, air pollution, social associations, and preventable hospital stays—providing. This gives us a comprehensive view of potential influences. By including each of these factors, we can gain a broad perspective on how health, socioeconomic, and environmental variables impact life expectancy.\nIn contrast, the Subset Model focused on a reduced set of predictors, the key predictor (severe housing problems) as well as selecting the strongest additional predictors identified during the EDA phase (physical inactivity and income inequality). This approach produced a simpler model, making it easier to understand which variables result in the most obvious effects.\nBefore fitting the models, we ensured that the data were partitioned into a training set (for model building) and a test set (for validation). As I mentioned earlier this step helped against overfitting and allowed for checking the model performance in a new dataset. Preliminary checks on the distribution of the outcome variable, along with residuals diagnostics performed after model fitting, to ensure that linear regression assumptions are reasonable in this setting. Needless mentioning that other tests indicated minor deviations from normality in residuals, however visual diagnostics suggested these deviations are not severe enough to effect the reliability of our model results.\nAfter getting the model results, the Full Model explained approximately 56.6% of the variability in life expectancy (R^2_adj = 0.5657), with an RMSE around 2.49. Significant predictors in this model included physical inactivity, income inequality, and preventable hospital stays, each exerting a meaningful and significant effect (p &lt; 0.001) on population-level health outcomes. (I also provide you with the full model coefficient plot for better visualisation)\nThe Subset Model, while simpler, led to almost comparable performance. It explaining around 55.4% of the variability in life expectancy, with an RMSE close to 2.51. This slight reduction in predictive accuracy is due to simplicity and ease of interpretation. Notably, the key predictors, physical inactivity and income inequality, remained highly significant. This reaffirm that these predictors playing central role in determining life expectancy. Severe housing problems also showed significance in certain categories, indicating that adverse living conditions can contribute to lower life expecteny in some cases.\nIn the analysis of the residuals from our linear regression models, I was able to conduct both visual and statistical assessments to evaluate the assumption of normality (not shown in dashboard, only in actaull qmd file). The visual inspections, including Q-Q plots and histograms, indicated that the residuals were approximately normally distributed. The Q-Q plots showed that the residuals closely followed the reference line, and the histograms displayed a bell-shaped distribution, both of which are consistent with normality.\nIn conclusion, while the Full Model provided slightly better performance, the Subset Model demonstrated comparable predictive power with fewer predictors, making it a viable option for simpler interpretation. The analysis confirmed that physical inactivity and income inequality are strong predictors of life expectancy, while the role of severe housing problems varied across categories.\n\n\n5 Conclusion\nIn Study 2, I identified and analyzed a set of predictors influencing life expectancy, focusing on severe housing problems as the key categorical variable, alongside important socioeconomic and behavioral factors. My Subset Model, revealed that while severe housing issues have some influence, it is the combination of physical inactivity and income inequality that most strongly explains variations in life expectancy. Our, initial hypothesis about the relationship of life expectancy with sever housing issues was true, however this is not the main and most impact reason for longevity.\nThis analysis was limited by the variables at hand and potential minor deviations from model assumptions. Future research should consider expanding the range of predictors and exploring more complex model structures, including interactions and non-linear relationships. Such efforts will enhance our understanding and help get more information on how to improve life expectancy."
