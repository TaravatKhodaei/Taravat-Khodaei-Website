I was able to contribute to the acedemic society through 11 published papers in this cutting-edge field. Currently, my laboratory work focuses on developing organoid models to mimic breast cancer biorespiration, providing valuable insights into cancer metabolism and potential therapeutic interventions. Through interdisciplinary research and innovative approaches, you aim to play a role in developing cancer treatment and immune system regulation methods.\nPlease feel free to contact me if you have any questions or would like to discuss potential projects.\n\nView the tutorial for this template (+ download link)"
